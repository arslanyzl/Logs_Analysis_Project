# Logs_Analysis_Project

### Project Overview
>This project is part of Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, we'll work with data that could have come from a real-world 
web application, with fields representing information that a web server would record, such as HTTP status codes and URL paths. 
The web server and the reporting tool both connect to the same database, allowing information to flow from the web server 
into the report.
